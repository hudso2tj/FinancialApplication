# MyMoneyCalcs (Work in progress)

I began making this application as a way to get more familiar with my personal finances as I get to the stage in my life where I really need to pay
close attention and save money. I figured what better way then to sharpen my skills and enhance my knowledge of financial topics than to create my own way
of calculating various finances and savings related content.

# Things I've done so far
- Developed a fully working salary calculator similar to the one found here: https://github.com/hudso2tj/Salary-Calculator.
- Implemented a basic preliminary design.
- Functionality of 4 of the 6 calculators.

# Features I have planned
- Retirement calculator that shows hypothetical retirement savings.
- Budget planner that helps analyze spending and monthly expense and income reports.
- Implementing visual aids to display calculator infortmation.

# Features I'm considering adding
- User login to be able to repeatedly access data from previous visits.
- Database integration to assist with the above point.
